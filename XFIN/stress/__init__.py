"""
XFIN Stress Testing Module (Placeholder)
==========================================

This module structure is set up for future full extraction of:
- ScenarioGenerator -> stress/scenarios.py
- PortfolioAnalyzer -> stress/portfolio_analyzer.py

Currently, these classes remain in stress_testing.py.
Import them from there directly:

    from XFIN.stress_testing import ScenarioGenerator, PortfolioAnalyzer

Full extraction is deferred to avoid breaking relative imports in stress_testing.py.

# Placeholder - full extraction deferred
# For now, import from the main module:
# from XFIN.stress_testing import ScenarioGenerator, PortfolioAnalyzer

__all__ = []
